Telegram is a communal chat tool. Everyone sees everything you write (don’t put personal information here!). Chat and ask questions Cen should reply to your question and remember information about you even though the chat channel is communal. 

Cen is  minded – watched over – by humans who will attempt to improve on the answers given by the AI in real time. Help us improve the system. 

If you get a good response type + and any comment e.g.,<br/>
 +great answer thanks.

Or bad,<br/>

But you can also just type + and –

Or even several plusses or minuses, we’ll get the idea.<br/>
+++ brilliant
